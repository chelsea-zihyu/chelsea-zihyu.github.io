            <p>App uses LBS (Location-Based Services) as the core technology to display the location of nearby members on the map, view the other user that are often passed by, and provide interactive action.
               However, Because of restriction of privacy ploicies, mobile not allow developer to read the user's real-time location and display it on the platform publicly. Therefore, it made us to think how to maintain the core value of the product and protect the privacy of the individual.

            <h3>There are more and more competing products in the market, how to  enhance uniqueness and increase App adhesion.</h3>

                The company's products had been online since 2012. As the competitive product  rise rapidly in the market, how to create unique functions from the user and increase adhesion, It is become the first thing we have to face.

                With the original concept, we start to brainstorming and organize ideas by mind map. Finally, we choose the idea of radar to show the location of the surrounding users. User is on the core of radar, the closer to the center is the one that may appear around the user.
