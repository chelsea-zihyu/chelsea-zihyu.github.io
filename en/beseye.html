At the same time, such a startup company which is striving for more venture capital on a regular basis, grab any chances to exposure and proactively takes business cooperation. Does it really make sense to do these things?<br>
                After that, I realized that UX is not independent. UX is a combination of user experience design and business strategy. To reach balances between user experience and business goals, and tries to put business benefit evaluation into the project. That is the value UX brings.
